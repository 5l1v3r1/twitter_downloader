twitter_downloader
==================

Notes
-----
Due to Twitter and Bit.ly API changes, valid credentials for each site are now required.  Both of them must be entered into the config.yml file.

QuickStart
----------
1. Rename config-sample.yml to config.yml
2. Replace values in the config.yml with real-world strings.
3. Run bundle (or rvm bundle, ie rvm 1.9.3 do bundle install)
4. Run script (ruby twitter_downloader.rb)
